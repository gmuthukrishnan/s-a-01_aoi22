# s-a-01_aoi22
Verilog Project to detect stuck at faults and generate fault report in an AOI22 circuit using basic gates (AND , OR, NOT structure).

This project is aimed to get a high level hands on experience with analysing single stuck at faults in a gate-level netlist structure. Eventhough AOI22 is a compound gate, this simple circuit is taken as the first step towards practical learning of DFT concepts.
